The folders in this directory demonstrate various RxJava Observable
(and Single) features, as follows:

. ex1 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously and concurrently using RxJava Flowable
        operators, including fromArray() and parallel(), and
        ParallelFlowable operators, including runOn(), flatMap(),
        sequential(), and reduce(), as well as the
        Schedulers.computation() thread pool.
        
. ex2 - This example shows how to apply timeouts with the asynchronous
        Single and ParallelFlowable classes in the RxJava framework.
