This directory contains all the Project Reactor source code examples
from my LiveTraining webinars and [courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DigitalLearning).
Here's an overview of what's included:

. ex1 - This class shows how to apply Project Reactor features
        synchronously to perform basic Mono and Flux operations,
        including just(), map(), subscribe(), fromCallable(), map(),
        doOnSuccess(), and then().

. ex2 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously using Mono and Flux features in the Reactor
        framework, including create(), interval(), map(), doOnNext(),
        take(), subscribe(), and then().

. ex3 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously and concurrently using many advanced Mono and
        Flux features in the Project Reactor framework, including
        flatMap(), collectList(), zipWith(), first(), take(), when(),
        subscribeOn(), create(), then(), and various thread pools.  It
        also demonstrates how to combine the Java streams framework
        with the Project Reactor framework.
