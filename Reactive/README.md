This directory contains all the Project Reactor source code examples
from my LiveTraining webinars and [courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DigitalLearning).
Here's an overview of what's included:

. ex1 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        synchronously using basic Reactor Mono and Flux features.

. ex2 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously and in parallel using advanced Reactor Mono and
        Flux features, such as flatMap(), collectList(), zipWith(),
        first(), when(), and onErrorResume().
