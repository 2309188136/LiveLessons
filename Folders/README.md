This directory contains Java source code examples from my [immersive
courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/courses.html) and
my Live Training courses.  Here's an overview of what's included:

. Async -- This example combines the Java completable futures
  framework with the Java sequential streams framework to process
  entries in a recursively-structured folder hierarchy concurrently.

. CustomStreams -- This example shows the use of the Java streams
  framework to process entries in a recursively-structured directory
  folder using custom spliterators and collectors for Java sequential
  and parallel streams.

. ForkJoin -- This example shows how to use various Java mechanisms
  (including the Java fork-join pool framework and sequential Streams
  framework) to count the number of files in a (large) recursive
  folder hierarchy, as well as calculate the cumulative sizes of all
  the files.

. ParallelStreams - This example shows how to use various Java
  sequential and parallel streams framework features to count the
  number of folders and documents in a (large) recursive folder
  hierarchy, as well as calculate the cumulative size in bytes of all
  the documents.

. Reactor -- This example shows the use of Project Reactor to process
  entries in a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially
  and concurrently.

. RxJava -- This example shows the use of RxJava to process entries in
  a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially and
  concurrently.

. WalkTree - This example shows how to use various Java directory
  traversal mechanisms to count the number of files in a (large)
  recursive folder hierarchy, as well as calculate the cumulative
  sizes of all the files.

. WebFlux -- This example shows how to use the Spring WebFlux
  framework together with Project Reactor to process entries in a
  large recursive directory folder concurrently as a web service.
